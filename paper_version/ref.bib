First, the quasi-neutral limit of fluid and kinetic models is investigated in the framework of non-magnetized as well as magnetized plasmas. Second, the drift limit for fluid descriptions of thermal plasmas under large magnetic fields is addressed. Finally efficient numerical resolutions of anisotropic elliptic or diffusion equations arising in magnetized plasma simulation are reviewed.}

abstract = {In this article, we design Asymptotic-Preserving Particle-In-Cell methods for the Vlasov–Maxwell system in the quasi-neutral limit, this limit being characterized by a Debye length negligible compared to the space scale of the problem. These methods are consistent discretizations of the Vlasov–Maxwell system which, in the quasi-neutral limit, remain stable and are consistent with a quasi-neutral model (in this quasi-neutral model, the electric field is computed by means of a generalized Ohm law). The derivation of Asymptotic-Preserving methods is not straightforward since the quasi-neutral model is a singular limit of the Vlasov–Maxwell model. The key step is a reformulation of the Vlasov–Maxwell system which unifies the two models in a single set of equations with a smooth transition from one to another. As demonstrated in various and demanding numerical simulations, the Asymptotic-Preserving methods are able to treat efficiently both quasi-neutral plasmas and non-neutral plasmas, making them particularly well suited for complex problems involving dense plasmas with localized non-neutral regions.}

abstract = {Classic Cartesian staggered mesh schemes have a number of attractive properties. They do not display spurious pressure modes and they have been shown to locally conserve, mass, momentum, kinetic energy, and circulation to machine precision. Recently, a number of generalizations of the staggered mesh approach have been proposed for unstructured (triangular or tetrahedral) meshes. These unstructured staggered mesh methods have been created to retain the attractive pressure aspects and mass conservation properties of the classic Cartesian mesh method. This work addresses the momentum, kinetic energy, and circulation conservation properties of unstructured staggered mesh methods. It is shown that with certain choices of the velocity interpolation, unstructured staggered mesh discretizations of the divergence form of the Navier–Stokes equations can conserve kinetic energy and momentum both locally and globally. In addition, it is shown that unstructured staggered mesh discretizations of the rotational form of the Navier–Stokes equations can conserve kinetic energy and circulation both locally and globally. The analysis includes viscous terms and a generalization of the concept of conservation in the presence of viscosity to include a negative definite dissipation term in the kinetic energy equation. These novel conserving unstructured staggered mesh schemes have not been previously analyzed. It is shown that they are first-order accurate on nonuniform two-dimensional unstructured meshes and second-order accurate on uniform unstructured meshes. Numerical confirmation of the conservation properties and the order of accuracy of these unstructured staggered mesh methods is presented.}

abstract = {It was proved that Euler-Maxwell systems converge globally-in-time to drift-diffusion systems in a slow time scaling, as the relaxation time goes to zero. The convergence was established to the Cauchy problem with smooth periodic initial data sufficiently close to constant equilibrium states. In this paper, we establish error estimates between smooth periodic solutions of Euler-Maxwell systems and those of drift-diffusion systems. Similar error estimates are also obtained for Euler-Poisson systems in place of Euler-Maxwell systems. The proof of these results uses stream function techniques together with energy estimates.
Résumé
Il a été prouvé que des systèmes d'Euler-Maxwell convergent globalement en temps vers des systèmes de dérive-diffusion dans une échelle de temps lent, lorsque le temps de relaxation tend vers zéro. La convergence a éte établie au problème de Cauchy avec données initiales régulières périodiques suffisamment proches d'états d'équilibres constants. Dans cet article, nous établissons des estimations d'erreur entre les solutions régulières périodiques des systèmes d'Euler-Maxwell et celles des systèmes de dérive-diffusion. Des estimations d'erreur similaires sont aussi obtenues pour des systèmes d'Euler-Poisson au lieu des systèmes d'Euler-Maxwell. Nous utilisons des techniques de fonctions de courant et des estimations d'energies pour la démonstration de ces résultats.}

    abstract = { We derive incompressible e-MHD equations from compressible Euler–Maxwell equations via the quasi-neutral regime. Under the assumption that the initial data are well prepared for the electric density, electric velocity, and magnetic field (but not necessarily for the electric field), the convergence of the solutions of the compressible Euler–Maxwell equations in a torus to the solutions of the incompressible e-MHD equations is justified rigorously by studies on a weighted energy. One of the main ingredients for establishing uniform a priori estimates is to use the curl-div decomposition of the gradient and the wave-type equations of the Maxwell equations. }

abstract = {Abstract We present a comprehensive and variational approach to the coupling of electromagnetic field models with circuit-type models. That coupling relies on integral nonlocal quantities like voltage and current for electric ports, magnetomotive force, and magnetic flux for magnetic ports, and linked currents and fluxes for “tunnels” in the field domain. These quantities are closely linked to nonbounding cycles studied in algebraic topology and they respect electromagnetic power balance laws. We obtain two dual variational formulations, called E-based and H-based, which provide a foundation for finite-element Galerkin discretization.},

If the underlying space domain is all of Rm, the convergence has been proved by several authors under appropriate assumptions on the convergence of the data (initial condition and external force); see Golovkin [1] and McGrath [2] for m = 2 and all time, and Swann [3] and the author [4,5] for m = 3 and short time. The case m ⩾ 4 can be handled in the same way; in fact, the simple method given in [5] applies to any dimension. All these results refer to strong solutions (or even classical solutions, depending on the data) of the Navier-Stokes equation.",

abstract = {We have developed a technique that allows for a sheath boundary layer without having to resolve the inherently small space and time scales of the sheath region. We refer to this technique as the logical sheath boundary condition. This boundary condition, when incorporated into a direct-implicit particle code, permits large space- and time-scale simulations of bounded systems, which would otherwise be impractical on current supercomputers. The lack of resolution of the collector sheath potential drop obtained from conventional implicit simulations at moderate values of ωpe Δt and Δ z/ λDe provides the motivation for the development of the logical sheath boundary condition. The algorithm for use of the logical sheath boundary condition in a particle simulation is presented. Results from simulations which use the logical sheath boundary condition are shown to compare reasonably well with those from an analytic theory and simulations in which the sheath is resolved.}

 abstract = {The aim of this paper is to analyze a finite element method to solve the low-frequency harmonic Maxwell equations in a bounded domain containing conductors and dielectrics. This system of partial differential equations is a model for the so-called eddy currents problem. After writing this problem in terms of the magnetic field, it is discretized by Nedelec edge finite elements on a tetrahedral mesh. Error estimates are easily obtained if the curl-free condition is imposed on the elements in the dielectric domain. Then, the curl-free condition is imposed, at a discrete level, by introducing a piecewise linear multivalued potential. The resulting problem is shown to be a discrete version of other continuous formulation in which the magnetic field in the dielectric part of the domain has been replaced by a magnetic potential. Moreover, this approach leads to an important saving in computational effort. Problems related to the topology are also considered in that the possibility of having a nonsimply connected dielectric domain is taken into account. Implementation issues are discussed, including an amenable procedure to impose the boundary conditions by means of a Lagrange multiplier. Finally, the method is applied to solve a three-dimensional model problem: a cylindrical electrode surrounded by dielectric.},
