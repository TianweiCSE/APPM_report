ABSTRACT = {Molecule radiation can be used as a tool to study colder regions in switching
                  arc plasmas like arc fringes in contact to walls and ranges around
                  current zero (CZ). This is demonstrated in the present study for the
                  first time for the case of ablation-dominated high-current arcs as key
                  elements of self-blast circuit breakers. The arc in a model circuit
                  breaker (MCB) in CO2 with and an arc in a long nozzle under ambient
                  conditions with peak currents between 5 and 10 kA were studied by
                  emission and absorption spectroscopy in the visible spectral range. The
                  nozzle material was polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in both
                  cases. Imaging spectroscopy was carried out either with high-speed
                  cameras or with intensified CCD cameras. A pulsed high-intensity Xe lamp
                  was applied as a background radiator for the broad-band absorption
                  spectroscopy. Emission of Swan bands from carbon dimers was observed at
                  the edge of nozzles only or across the whole nozzle radius with highest
                  intensity in the arc center, depending on current and nozzle
                  geometry. Furthermore, absorption of C2 Swan bands and CuF bands were
                  found with the arc plasma serving as background radiator. After CZ, only
                  CuF was detected in absorption experiments.},

title = {Thermal Plasma Modelling},
journal = {Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics},
abstract = {Electrical arcs and, more generally thermal plasmas, are widely used in many
                  applications and the understanding or the improvement of the
                  corresponding processes or systems, often requires precise modelling of
                  the plasma. We present, here, a double approach to thermal plasma
                  modelling, which combines the scientific procedure with an engineering
                  point of view. First, we present the fundamental properties of thermal
                  plasmas that are required in the models, followed by the basic equations
                  and structures of the models. The third part is devoted to test cases,
                  and its objectives are the study of some basic phenomena to show their
                  influence on arc behaviour in simple configurations, and the validation
                  of the models: we point out the roles of radiation, thermal conductivity
                  and electrical conductivity for a stationary or transient
                  wall-stabilized arc and we validate a three-dimensional model for a
                  free-burning arc.  Sections 4–6 deal with several industrial
                  configurations and the model is useful in each case for studying
                  important phenomena or processes in greater detail. For transferred
                  arcs, such as those used in metallurgy, the energy transfer from the arc
                  to the anode, and the presence of metallic vapour and pumping gas are
                  essential. For a non-transferred plasma torch used for plasma spraying,
                  we illustrate the relevance of a three-dimensional model and we present
                  the interaction of the plasma with powders. Problems related to high-
                  and low-voltage circuit-breakers are then presented, and various typical
                  mechanisms are modelled. Finally, several non-equilibrium models useful
                  for quasi-thermal conditions are presented in detail, showing how they
                  take into account the chemical kinetics and two-temperature plasmas
                  occurring under particular conditions, such as decaying arcs or
                  inductively coupled plasmas.}
